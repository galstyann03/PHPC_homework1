Declare a function swap(int *a, int *b) that swaps two integers using pointers.
In main(), two integer variables are declared and initialized.
The program prints the values of the integers before calling swap()
swap() is called with the addresses of the two integers
After the function call, the program prints the values again, showing that the original integers were successfully swapped.

If passed the values 10, 20 but not the addresses, the function will not be able to reference the original variables and
will only replace the local copies of the integers within the function, leaving the original values unchanged in main()
