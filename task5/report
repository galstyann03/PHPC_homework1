allocates memory for one integer and p stores its address.
then assigns a value to the allocated memory. Printing *p shows the stored value.

int *arr = malloc(SIZE * sizeof(int)); allocates memory for an array of 5 integers. arr points to the first element.

The loop fills the array using pointer arithmetic, moving through the memory addresses and storing values.
Another loop prints the array

free(p); free(arr); releases the memory, ensuring no memory leaks occur
